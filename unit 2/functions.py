# function - a function is a set of code instructions 
# for a computer to follow. 
 
# function comes in two phases 
 
# phas 1 : function defintion 
 # we are describing the function  instruction on what we want 
# this code to do. its only runs when we call it 
 
def example():
   print ('Good moring') 

def example2(): 
    print ('good day') 
      
# phase 2 : function call/ invocation 
#when we are ready to use a function,
# we write it to use it
example() 
example2() 
 

def math (): 
    a= input (' enter a number:') 
    print(a + b) 
      
 # phase 2: function call
  # once we have the defintion we can run the instructions  
  # by writing the function name. 
example() 
 
 # we indent to inform the computer that we are about to write 
 # code instructions. if we dont we will get an error. 
  
def example2():
     print ('good day') 
     a= input ('enter a number')
